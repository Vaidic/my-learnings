# Problem Statement: E-commerce Microservices Platform

## Background

Our rapidly growing e-commerce company is facing challenges with its monolithic architecture. As the user base expands and product offerings increase, we're experiencing scalability issues, difficulties in implementing new features, and maintenance complexities. To address these challenges, we need to transition to a microservices-based architecture.

## Current Challenges

1. Scalability: The current monolithic system struggles to handle increased load during peak shopping periods.
2. Feature Implementation: Adding new features or updating existing ones is time-consuming and risky, often affecting the entire system.
3. Technology Stack: We're limited by our current technology choices, making it difficult to adopt new technologies for specific functionalities.
4. Deployment: The entire application must be deployed for any change, leading to longer deployment times and increased risk.
5. Team Productivity: Different teams working on various aspects of the application often face conflicts and integration issues.

## Project Objectives

Develop a microservices-based e-commerce platform that addresses the above challenges, with the following key components and features:

1. API Gateway

   - Centralized entry point for all client requests
   - Implement security and routing

2. Authentication Service

   - Handle user authentication
   - Implement JWT-based authentication

3. Product Service

   - Manage product catalog and inventory

4. Order Service

   - Process and manage customer orders

5. User Service

   - Manage user profiles and preferences

6. Service Discovery
   - Enable dynamic service registration and discovery

## Key Requirements

1. Scalability: Each service should be independently scalable.
2. Security: Implement JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
3. Resilience: Services should be fault-tolerant and implement circuit breaking.
4. Observability: Implement logging, monitoring, and tracing across services.
5. Data Consistency: Ensure data consistency across services, especially for critical operations.
6. Performance: The system should handle high concurrent user loads with minimal latency.
7. DevOps: Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Improved scalability to handle increasing load and user base.
2. Faster time-to-market for new features and updates.
3. Enhanced system resilience and fault tolerance.
4. Improved development team productivity and autonomy.
5. Better resource utilization and cost-efficiency in cloud environments.
6. Increased flexibility in adopting new technologies for specific services.

## Success Criteria

1. The system can handle a 300% increase in peak load compared to the current monolithic system.
2. Deployment frequency increases by 200% without an increase in production issues.
3. Time required for implementing new features reduces by 50%.
4. System uptime improves to 99.99%.
5. Average response time for API requests reduces by 40%.

By successfully implementing this microservices architecture, we aim to position our e-commerce platform for future growth, improved customer experience, and enhanced competitiveness in the market.
